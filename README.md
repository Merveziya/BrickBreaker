# Arduino Brick Breaker Game

The game involves controlling a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks displayed on an OLED screen. The player scores points by breaking bricks, and the game increases in difficulty as levels progress. This repository contains the code and resources for a microcontroller-based game machine using Arduino and Proteus. 

## Features
- Physical paddle control using a potentiometer
- OLED display for game visualization
- Scoring system displayed on a seven-segment display
- Increasing difficulty with each level
- Life count displayed using LEDs
- Random power-ups to increase lives

## Technologies Used
- **Arduino IDE**: Used for writing and uploading the code to the microcontroller.
- **Proteus**: Used for circuit simulation and design.
- **OLED Display**: For game visualization.
- **Potentiometer**: For paddle control.
- **Seven-Segment Display**: For displaying scores.
- **LEDs**: For displaying the player's remaining lives.
